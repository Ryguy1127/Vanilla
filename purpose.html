                <h2>Bikes Missing a Bolt?! We Can Help!</h2>
                <h3>The biggest activity that attracts people to my website are the dirt bikes, but we are also known for selling the best parts as well. If you purchase our insurance with the bikes or parts we will cover all damage to the bike up to 500 dollars. Our insurance is what brings people to our website because you have probably realized we are the only ones that offer a 500 dollar coverage plan. The way our website is set up is so even the youngest and oldest of our customers can find the parts they are needing. We also have a "refer a friend" if you set up an account with us. If you refer a friend to join you get 50 dollars per friend referred. </h3>

                    Frequently asked questions on our webpage is what is the best bike to buy. They all are quality and well maintained bikes here at our company. Of course each bike has their best quality. For example the shocks on our Honda bikes are stiffer than the Yamaha, but the engine on the Honda gives more torque than the Yamaha. Then of course you have the varying questions on parts for their bikes. Our crew is the best in the business at getting you what you need for the most convenient cost. We also get customers asking us about our policy on if you find the part cheaper somewhere else we will match it and give free shipping.</h3>
