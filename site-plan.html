        My website is there to help the customers that are in need of bikes, parts, and accessories.

If they come to our website looking for help they will have the smoothest process in purchasing whatever you need from buying the biggest and baddest bike to the smallest bolt for your bike. <br>
        This goes back to our refer a friend policy. For example when one friend joins our site and creates the account. He can then refer a friend and both of them will receive 50 dollars for in store credit. Customers are allowed to refer as many friends as they want but can only save up to 200 dollars in store credit. This brings a majority of our customers to our website. Then of course most people enjoy our site because we sell both parts and bikes at such a reasonable

        We would need you to set up an account with us. For example we would only need first and last names, your email (and no we wonâ€™t spam you with our special deals unless you mark to do so), your address, and your payment information. We accept paypal so if you need to set up an account for that you can find the link to do so as you are creating your profile. We have one of the most secure customer experience websites on the market. We do everything we can to protect the information given to us <br>
        Frequently asked questions on our webpage is what is the best bike to buy. They all are quality and well maintained bikes here at our company. Of course each bike has their best quality. For example the shocks on our Honda bikes are stiffer than the Yamaha, but the engine on the Honda gives more torque than the Yamaha. Then of course you have the varying questions on parts for their bikes. Our crew is the best in the business at getting you what you need for the most convenient cost. We also get customers asking us about our policy on if you find the part cheaper somewhere else we will match it and give free shipping.

        The biggest activity that attracts people to my website are the dirt bikes.We are most known for selling the best bikes and if they purchase our insurance with the bike we will cover all damage to the bike up to 500 dollars. Our agents have told us that the insurance is what brings people to our website. Then the way our website is set up so even the youngest and oldest of our customers can find the parts they are needing. We also have to refer a friend if you set up an account with us and refer a friend to join you get 50 dollars per friend referred. By doing that it adds a lot of traffic to our site for people to see if we are actually worth their time and money.
